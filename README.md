Analysis of the FBI's public Uniform Crime Reporting

This notebook is an update of Mean Shift Analysis I first performed in 2017 to examine the recent increases in crime following the historic decrease
during the late 1990s and early 2000s. For instance, was crime increasing everywhere or just in certain cities, such as Baltimore? By grouping cities
into clusters based on their crime patterns over time, we can see  where crime is continuing to fall and where it is rising.

The notebook will look at crime rates in jurisdictions over 250,000 people. These 131 jurisdictions account for approximately 30% of the US population.
They are a mix of urban areas such as cities and suburbs, and also suburban counties. Urban areas are over-represented, but there are enough lower 
density jurisdictions to conduct analysis.

The notebook generates two html files (agg_assault_lines.html and crime_us_map.html) to visualize the results.
